## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org)

In order for the authorization component of this app to work, it needs to be registered with Google. Here is a helpful walkthrough of that process: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project.

You will want to register **Type** as **Web application**, set **Authorized JavaScript origins** to
http://localhost:4000 (if you're running the application locally) and set the **Authorized
redirect URI** to http://localhost:4000/auth/google/callback (this can be set through the Google API
Console Dashboard under **Credentials** if not offered as an option during setup).

You will also need to enable the "Google+ API" on the Google API Console Dashboard - if you forget,
Google will display an error message (with a link to the API) the first time you try to log in.

### Steps

- Fork and clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- In the root directory, create a .env file and place the following: 
  - MONGO_URI = *Your database uri - typically mongodb://localhost:27017/your_project_name if your MongoDB is local* 
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = *Client id assigned by Google* 
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = *Client secret assigned by Google*
  - SESSION_SECRET = *Any random string of characters*
  - GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL = http://localhost:4000/auth/google/callback (*Use for the callback url in the Google API console*)
- Open a new terminal session and run `mongod` if mongodb is on the local machine
- Run `npm run dev`
- Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, the following commands are available:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies

### `npm run dev`

Builds the app for development. It is watched by webpack for any changes in the front end.
